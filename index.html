        <h1>About</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p> I have many hobbies but my most favourite hobby is cricket. When I get some free time after my studies,I go outside to the ground with my friends and play cricket. Cricket is the game which requires physical fitness. The running between the wickets,
            fielding within the ground and stress bearing during batting and fielding make my body fit and mind fresh. So, after playing cricket when I study, I can better grab the concepts. I also become delighted by playing cricket because I donâ€™t waste my
            mind sitting in front of a computer or playing video games. Instead, I do some healthy activity. On every Sunday evening, I have two or three hours free. Mostly, I play cricket at that time. I have purchased my cricket kit. I also got another benefit.</p>
